## Dashboard Layout

* Dashboards are divided in the layout into two columns
* The left column holds a chart, the right a text area containing notes for that chart
* The style of the chart is not important, only the query, dimensions and measures selected
* The chart type, title, colors, etc. are contained in the chart notes
* The title of the chart on the left is meant to be used as the chart ID in the json file, this allows is to control the mapping between charts in dashboards and charts in LWC components

## Color Scheme
